Create an app which will display a weather for a list of cities on the map.

Requirements
Project must be done React.js.
You should use typescript.
Project should be deployed and be available live (use Github pages, Heroku or any other free hosting).
Use Mapbox to add a map.
You can use any other additional libs if you need, it is up to you.
App should be responsive and usable on mobile/tablet/desktop screens.
Place your code on github (or any other platform you prefer to store your code). Send us back a link to it. Make sure it is public.
Your task
There should be a sidebar with 20 random cities from all over the world (up to you, select any you want).
There should be an input which will start filter cities by entered value (mini search). It should filter cities only from available list.
When I click on a city name from the list, I should switch to it on a map. There should be displayed an information icon (you can use any from the internet or from any font icons).
When I click an icon, I should see a mapbox popup with a weather forecast. Please, add a forecast for today and tomorrow (design is up to you)
